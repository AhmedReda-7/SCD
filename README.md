Introduction to Data Warehousing (Quick Series)

Before diving into the fundamentals of Data Warehousing, it's essential to understand one of the core concepts in data management:
Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD).

In any data system, we typically deal with two main types of data:

Historical Data â€“ previously stored records

New Data â€“ incoming records from the data extraction process

Why do we need SCD?
In real-world scenarios, data changes over time.

For example:

An employee gets promoted, resulting in a salary increase

A customer changes their residential address

A client updates their marital status from "Single" to "Married"

These kinds of changes donâ€™t occur frequently, but when they do, we need a structured approach to manage and track them.
This is where Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) come into playâ€”offering multiple strategies to handle data changes effectively.

Common Types of SCD:
ðŸ”¹ SCD Type 0 â€“ Fixed (No Change)

The data remains unchanged regardless of any updates

Changes are ignored as they are considered irrelevant for analysis

ðŸ”¹ SCD Type 1 â€“ Overwrite

The existing value is replaced with the new one

No historical data is retained

ðŸ”¹ SCD Type 2 â€“ Full Historical Tracking âœ…

The most widely used type

Every change is recorded as a new row with a version, flag, or date range

Example:
An employeeâ€™s salary progression: 1600 â†’ 2000 â†’ 5000 â†’ 8000
Each salary record is stored with flags (e.g., 1 for current, 0 for historical) or date ranges (e.g., Start_Date and End_Date)
The most recent record may have a NULL End_Date or a default far-future date like 31/12/9999

ðŸ”¹ SCD Type 3 â€“ Current and Previous Values

Stores only the current and immediately previous values

Useful when full history is not required, but the most recent change matters

ðŸ”¹ SCD Type 4 â€“ Historical Table

Historical data is stored in a separate table

This approach improves data integrity and maintains a clean structure in the main dimension table

These are the most commonly used SCD types. Understanding them is crucial when designing and maintaining a Data Warehouse.

In the next post, Iâ€™ll discuss the structure and design principles of a Data Warehouse.
